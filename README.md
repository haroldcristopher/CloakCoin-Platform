## Compiling GUI CloakCoin wallet from source

#### Disclaimer

**We advise you that compiling from source gives you a bleeding edge version of the CloakCoin wallet. This means there might be bugs, crashes, and you could lose your Cloaks. Therefore, to avoid any issue, you should never run a development wallet on the same computer as the stable wallet which holds your Cloaks.**

By default, development wallet runs on TestNet, but you can never be too safe.

### Dependencies

To install the dependencies, you need to use your system package manager:
- Windows: you will need to download/compile the proper DLLs needed, depending on your system gen & version; this is very hard to get right (libcurl...), not recommended for beginners. 
- Ubuntu: use `sudo apt-get install *package*`. To install all at once, including build tools (not listed in the chart): `sudo apt-get install git make build-essential g++ qttools5-dev-tools qt5-default libboost-all-dev libleveldb-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libevent-dev libminiupnpc libqrencode-dev`
- Mac OS X: install [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/), and use `brew install *package*`. To install all at once: `brew install qt boost@1.57 leveldb curl openssl libevent berkeley-db@4 miniupnpc`

_\* Those specific version are known to work. Latest versions are known not to work._

_\*\* Debian and Ubuntu refer to version< <= 7.15 as libcurl3, and versions >= 7.16 as libcurl4, because of an API change. You need libcurl4._

_\*\*\* This version is very specific, as 1.9 seems to have some non-compatible changes. 2.0 probably won't work (test needed). **WARNING** This is included for historic reasons, but you should not use it, as it is a known security hole. It's disabled by default._

### Compiling

You can either use the command line or import the .pro file in Qt Creator.

Using the command line, run:
```qmake && make```
